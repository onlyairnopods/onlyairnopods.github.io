# About Me

Hi thereðŸ‘‹, I am currently a master student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Benyou Wang. I am also profoundly grateful to my former mentor, Prof. Dayan Guan, who guided me into research journey.

My research interests include Science for next-gen AI (architectures, algorithms), AI4Science (especially AI4Chemistry and AI4Materials), Multimodal-LLMs. I am also interested in building robots/agents for automated scientific exploration.
