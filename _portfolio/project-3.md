## Overview

I joined the RoboMaster team at college in my sophomore year to participate in the prestigious RoboMaster competition. Afterwards, I was honored to serve as the head of Deep Learning Group in Vision Sector, leading the group to design high-precision real-time automatic recognition and aiming systems for our team's combat robots.

## Technical Highlights

- Collected and analyzed datasets of armor plates, and developed scripts for datasets processing.
- Studied object detection models such as YOLO, customized yolov5-face into a four-keypoint model, and introduced Normalized Mean Error metric to optimize and enhance the modelâ€™s performance.
- Deployed the model using C++ and ROS2 framework, leveraged CUDA and TensorRT libraries to accelerate model inference speed on NVIDIA Jetson series edge development boards.
